# Data Science Portfolio
<sub>Repository of Data Science Projects</sub>

Ever since I was a kid, my dream is to be recognized by helping people solve their problems and achieve their goals. To accomplish this dream, I have focused mainly on giving solutions to improve results, what has developed problem-solving skills and critical thinking in me. Also, as a passionate about data, I became realy interested in how Data Science and Machine Learning skills could help me to enable other people`s success.

Now, I feel there is certainly much more to learn, and this dream still burns inside me. I love improving my skills, hard or soft, day after day, through courses and books, so that I can come up with many other solutions for the area that I work today, and open a future of new possibilities!
