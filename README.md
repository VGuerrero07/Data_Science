# Data Science Portfolio
<sub>Repository of Data Science Projects</sub>

I want more than just seeing the data revolution of our times; I want to be an **effective part of it**.

As information increasingly becomes more important as an asset, it appears from everything, everywhere. Not handling it properly may confuse more than organize ideas and provide better decision-making.

This is exactly why I started studying Data Science, Machine Learning, Big data, and Business Intelligence: to **transform information into actual values that companies can use for growth, survivability, competitiveness, and much more**.

The Engineering background made me develop problem-solving and project management skills. With that in mind and with the dream to affect every person around me, I want to allign both knowledges to cause immediate impact and **make peoples lives easier!**
