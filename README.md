# Data Science Portfolio
<sub>Repository of Data Science Projects</sub>

As a person of Exact Sciences and former Chemical Engineering student, I have developed **robust critical thinking and problem-solving skills** during my experiences, either by working on practical projects or studying hard for the courses. They are two of my most prominent characteristics to this day.

Also, as a **passionate about data and how it can impact processes, businesses, and (most important) DREAMS**, I became really interested in studying Data Science and Machine Learning skills by myself, focusing on solving problems and getting insights with data available online.

Finally, I grew great interest in Management and Businesses in my Graduation, what led me into mixing Management and Engineering courses all together and into developing **business thinking and knowledge**.

Now, I feel there is certainly much more to learn to accomplish my dream: to be recognized by helping people solve their problems and achieve their goals. This is why I have always loved helping people around me, and why I **always strive to be better than I was yesterday**!
