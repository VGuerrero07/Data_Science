# Data Science Portfolio
<sub>Repository of Data Science Projects</sub>

As a person of Exact Sciences and former Chemical Engineering student, I have developed **robust critical thinking and problem-solving skills** during my experiences, either by working on practical projects or studying hard for the courses. They are two of my most prominent characteristics to this day. Also, as a **passionate about data and how it can impact processes, businesses, and (most important) DREAMS**, I became really interested in studying Data Science and Machine Learning skills by myself, focusing on solving problems and getting insights with data available online. Finally, I grew great interest in Management and Businesses in my Graduation, what led me into mixing Management and Engineering courses all together and into developing **business thinking and knowledge**.

This repository is to show my Data Science projects, where I can practice my skills and get better everyday!
